                <p className="text-lg flex-wrap text-justify leading-none max-sm:text-md">I'm an 18-year-old Brazilian programmer from SÃ£o Paulo, passionate about technology. Despite my initial shyness, I am an extroverted individual when discussing topics I'm passionate about. I'm excited to start studying at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in 2023 and constantly seek opportunities to expand my programming skills. I believe in the transformative power of technology and aim to develop innovative solutions to real-world challenges. Collaboration and effective communication are important to me, and I'm open to new connections and opportunities.</p>
